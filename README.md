# Next FullStack Starter

Next.js + Prisma + TailwindCSS + (Type-)GraphQL

This project serves as the starting point of some of my SaaS products, so I'm continuously improving it.

## Documentation

### Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Style guide

#### Variable casing

Use snake_case in `schema.prisma` and GraphQL types, otherwise camelCase is preferred.

#### Filename casing

Use PascalCase for React Components, other wise use kebab-case.
